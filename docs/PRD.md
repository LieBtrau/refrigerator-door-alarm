The kitchen contains a fridge built into a cabinet.  Slamming the cabinet door to close the fridge, leaves the fridge open at a tiny gap.  The light of the fridge is out, but the fridge isn't closed and as a result the surrounding heat rushes in.  The end result is an elevated electricity bill.
* Replacing the fridge's rubber by a new one, which is more magnetic will be hard to do if we can find the parts.  And how reliable will this new rubber seal be?
* Mounting the fridge at an angle, so that the door closes by itself is not possible, because the fridge's door is attached to the cabinet door.  The fridge needs to be perfectly horizontal.
* I don't want to damage the cabinet by adding extra springs or levers to pull the door shut.  Even if I wanted, there's very little room for such solutions.

# Objective

Design a device that gives an audible warning after one minute when the fridge door has not been fully closed.

# Assumptions, constraints
* The fridge is not replaced by one where the rubber seal works magnetically better.
* No modification of the fridge itself allowed.  The integrity of the seal between the fridge and its door must be maintained.
* no drilling in the kitchen cabinets is allowed

# Dependencies

# Background & Strategic Fit
... Risk management

# Scope
... User Stories & Requirements
... stakeholder's expectations

# Product Features

## Enclosure
* 25mm max height (vertical)
* 45mm max depth (between cabinet door and front of the fridge)

### Installation
* easy to install and to remove.

## Electronics
* standalone, no wiring to power socket

## Functionality
* Visual indication that device is operational when door is open.
* Audible alert when the door has not been fully closed for more than one minute.
* User can disable the audio alert (e.g. during cleaning of the fridge)
* In case batteries are used: LOBATT warning needed.
* Should work at least one year without user maintenance (e.g. replacing batteries)
